Refaat was a guiding light as a I documented life and death for my documentary, Killing Gaza. He helped me gain access to elders in his neighborhood who provided testimony of shocking Israeli war crimes.  In one of our last exchanges, I told him that, in my time in Gaza, I felt as though I were documenting the Warsaw Ghetto before its liquidation by Nazis. I promised him that his writings would be featured in a future Victims of Zionism museum. I didn't imagine that would be my last message to him.

The Zionist war machine, in Jabalia, Al-Shati, Al-Nuseirat, Deir Al-Balah, Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, to which this wounded child (Leah Al-Houbi) was forcibly displaced from her home in Deir Al-Balah, and she was bombed by the Nazi occupation, and her words remain: (We must liberate our beloved Jerusalem and return to our homeland). -------------------  In the beginning, we reassure the masses of our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and all the free people in the world, that your victorious resistance is still leading and managing the chapters of the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood on the sixty-second day, with all strength, wisdom, and ability, in which it is writing a heroic epic, as it defends its people, its land, and its sanctity. The furthest of them is the blessed one, and it infiltrates the enemy's Nazi army, killing its soldiers and officers either dead or wounded, or permanently disabled, or completely or partially blinded, and destroying its military vehicles from a distance of zero, rendering them out of service or scattered in pieces, or charred by the cowardly, murderous soldiers in them. Of the mercenaries used by this Nazi enemy. While it was documented that “more than 410 Zionist military vehicles were completely or partially destroyed since the start of the ground aggression” on the Gaza Strip, and dozens of soldiers and officers of the occupation army and brigade commanders were killed, and according to the enemy’s confession, 90 soldiers and officers were killed, and certainly, the real number is many times that. The number of enemy wounded exceeds 2,000, hundreds of whom were seriously injured.  Our resistance fighters are still valiant in the field, and on all fronts. They are coming out from under the ground, above it, and from under the rubble. They are destroying its armored vehicles and tanks and killing its soldiers and officers. They are documenting this with audio and video.  These great sacrifices and daily field victories made by our resistors; At the forefront of them are the Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which is a prelude to the great victory, God Almighty willing, and our victorious resistance is ready to continue confronting and confronting the enemy with all strength and courage, regardless of the duration and extent of the aggression.  With more than two months having passed since the genocidal war waged by the occupation against the Gaza Strip, in which it used bombing with all kinds of Zionist and American weapons and bombs, and practiced a dirty policy, through starvation, thirst, and the destruction of all components of human life, during which it received open American and Western support at all levels, with The continuation of international inaction, failure, and silence in stopping this barbaric, aggressive war, which has left, to date, more than 60,000 of our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and occupied Jerusalem, martyred, wounded, and missing.

316,@MaryKostakidis,"Omer Bartov, professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, in the NYT: ‘What we had warned about — that it would be impossible to ignore the occupation and oppression of millions for 56 years, and the siege of Gaza for 16 years, without consequences — exploded in our faces on Oct. 7. Following Hamas’s massacre of innocent Jewish civilians, our same group issued a second petition denouncing the crimes committed by Hamas and calling upon the Israeli government to desist from perpetrating mass violence and killings upon innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza in response to the crisis. We wrote that the only way to put an end to these cycles of violence is to seek a political compromise with the Palestinians and end the occupation. It is time for leaders and senior scholars of institutions dedicated to researching and commemorating the Holocaust to publicly warn against the rage- and vengeance-filled rhetoric that dehumanizes the population of Gaza and calls for its extinction. It is time to speak out against the escalating violence on the West Bank, perpetrated by Israeli settlers and I.D.F. troops, which now appears to also be sliding toward ethnic cleansing under the cover of war in Gaza; several Palestinian villages have reportedly self-evacuated under threats from settlers. I urge such venerable institutions as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to step in now and stand at the forefront of those warning against war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and the crime of all crimes, genocide. If we truly believe that the Holocaust taught us a lesson about the need — or really, the duty — to preserve our own humanity and dignity by protecting those of others, this is the time to stand up and raise our voices, before Israel’s leadership plunges it and its neighbors into the abyss. There is still time to stop Israel from letting its actions become a genocide. We cannot wait a moment longer.’",303,"Dec 7, 2023 · 12:36 PM UTC"

366,@propandco,"All of this serves as a masterful distraction from the actual genocide taking place in Gaza.   While thousands of Palestinian children are being blown to bits and pieces by an Israeli government and populace that have expressed actual genocidal intent more times than can be counted, privileged Ivy League students are victimizing themselves and acting as if they are experiencing a second Jewish Holocaust.   And for what?   It's because they are attempting to silence criticisms of the Israeli government and its policies.  This hysteric attempt to twist the meaning of Palestinian phraseology and conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism is absurd.   It is nothing but an effort to criminalize free speech that they disagree with.   It is not their lives that are threatened, but rather their narrative and world view that are being challenged. Whether  it be because they have bought into the propaganda of a genocidal apartheid state or advancing the agenda pro-Israel political and action groups, they are in fact actively contributing to an actual Holocaust of the Palestinian people.    An 'intifada’ is an uprising, a completely reasonable and justifiable action taken by a people living under military occupation and apartheid for decades.   Intifada does not relate to genocide in any way, neither in meaning nor intent.   The Ivy League Jewish student is potentially one of the most protected and coddled demographics in the country.   To see them play the victim like this is not just disingenuous; it is incredibly narcissistic and intentionally deceptive.  We live in a dystopian reality, where real tragedies are overshadowed by a skewed narrative propagated by the privileged.  Consider how multiple Congressmen are affording a platform to students to articulate their concerns. These same congressmen that vote overwhelmingly to conflate antizionism with antisemitism and then provide billions of dollars of weapons for the continued murder of men, women, and children by the Zionist state.   And just about every media establishment in the country is covering this topic. The same media establishment that ignored the fact that 700 Palestinian civilians died in a single day!  But the Ivy school elite want to feign vulnerability ?   This is nothing more than a coordinated effort by Zionists in America to pressure university administrations into criminalizing the speech of their victims and political opponents. A tactic used throughout history by the oppressors on their victims.   They are no longer interested in debating whether the military occupation of Palestine is a brutal and illegal violation of human rights.   They no longer wish to discuss the racist apartheid system Israel has established in the West Bank.   They no longer wish to hear of the pogroms that displace Palestinians in the West Bank carried out by violent Israeli settlers; many of these settlers being American citizens!    They no longer wish to hear about the plight of the people of Gaza prior to October 7th.   They are tired of hearing about Palestinian human rights.  So they are exploiting this crisis to criminalize speech and censor it once and for all.   It's a shameful tactic and should be resisted by all those who profess to cherish free speech and human life.",2576,"Dec 7, 2023 · 4:55 PM UTC"
