309,@Al_HindMuslims,"Palestine and the Information War  “If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” ― Malcolm X  Over two thousand years ago, the Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu recognized that wars are fought not only on the battlefield. “To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the height of (military) skill”, he said. “To subdue the enemy without fighting, that is the height of (military) skill”.  To achieve this, Sun Tzu further said, ‘A leader who wants to go to battle must first unite his people behind him. The people must be convinced he has their interests at heart, and that these interests are fair, righteous and just. If at the same time the enemy can be divided and demotivated, the battle is likely to be won well before a sword is drawn or a shot is fired.”  In the modern world, countries follow Sun Tzu’s sage advice by engaging in information warfare. Information warfare is a narrative or a storyline that gives meaning to a series of events and occurrences. As such, a narrative guides people to a specific understanding, and thereby to specific opinions and feelings regarding what is happening around them.  A famous example of narrative warfare is America’s effort to win “hearts and minds” as part of its war in Iraq.[1] In order to unite Western audiences behind America’s plan to invade and occupy Iraq, the American military hired a private company, the Rendon Group, to change the image of Saddam Hussein from “evil but weak dictator” to “powerful evil dictator with weapons of mass destruction intent on causing war globally”.[2] And in order to discourage the people of Iraq from fighting in support of Saddam Hussein’s regime, America dropped more than 25 million leaflets in Iraq which encouraged Iraqi civilians and soldiers to not only see Saddam Hussein as the evil dictator he was, but also America as a benevolent liberator.[3] Thereafter, when the American military in Iraq began to be confronted by a popular resistance movement because it failed to act as a benevolent liberator, America launched a propaganda campaign to make the people believe the popular resistance was in reality a branch of Al Qaeda, led by a Jordanian with the name Musab Al Zarqawi. This was done firstly to hide the fact there was a popular resistance in Iraq, and secondly to get Western and Iraqi audiences to support America’s military actions against this popular resistance.[4]",1,"Dec 8, 2023 · 2:08 AM UTC"

""If I must die,  you must live  to tell my story  to sell my things  to buy a piece of cloth  and some strings,  (make it white with a long tail)  so that a child, somewhere in Gaza  while looking heaven in the eye  awaiting his dad who left in a blaze-  and bid no one farewell  not even to his flesh  not even to himself-  sees the kite, my kite you made, flying up above  and thinks for a moment an angel is there  bringing back love  If I must die  let it bring hope  let it be a tale""  Refaat was killed in an Israeli airstrike on his home.  Israel targeted him.  Not Hamas,  They targeted HIM.  Israel went out of their way to specifically MURDER Refaat.  Do not forget this.  This is the reality of the Israeli terrorist regime.
