# Research Repository: 🌐 Applying Graph Theory in Decision Trees for Public Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Tweets about the Israel-Palestine Conflict 🌐

Welcome to the repository dedicated to my research project, "Applying Graph Theory in Decision Trees for Public Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Tweets about the Israel-Palestine Conflict." This project was undertaken as part of my third-semester coursework in Discrete Mathematics at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB).

## 🚀 Project Highlights

1. **Twitter Data Collection:** Leveraging the power of Nitter Scraper, I conducted Twitter scraping to gather a comprehensive dataset of tweets pertaining to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

2. **Decision Tree Construction:** The project involved a unique approach to sentiment analysis, where I manually constructed a decision tree by implementing graph structures in the form of a tree. Graph theory concepts were creatively applied to design an intuitive decision-making structure.
