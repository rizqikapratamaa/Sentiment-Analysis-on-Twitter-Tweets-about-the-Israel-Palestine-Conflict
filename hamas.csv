The body of Shani Louk on the lorry, with these horrible Hamas men spitting on her and shouting Allahu Akbar, is the most horrible thing. As a woman, as a mother, as a human being and a politician, I felt a deep disgust when I heard the silence of so many powerful people after these October 7 crimes.   The crime of these girls in Hamas eyes? Existing. Being Jewish, going to a festival. Shani Louk was young, she wanted to enjoy her life. Instead her life ended in the hands of Hamas. She was thrown onto this lorry, and we saw Hamas men dragging her half-naked with this lorry around and spitting on her, shouting “Allah Akbar”. For me, this image is worth more than 1,000 investigations, this image is stronger than 1,000 words, this image says it all. She and all others were someone’s daughters. How could the world let them down?    Anyone who isn’t outraged and doesn’t stand up to what we’ve seen, frankly I don’t know whether that person deserves to be called a feminist or a humanist, but it’s a betrayal. It’s a betrayal of the cause of women and it’s a betrayal of all Jews, it’s a betrayal of humanity.  For all the women and girls I joined forces with other women around the world to call for justice.

And he says this with a smirk on his face 🤢  In this particular case that hospital was forcibly evacuated by the IDF and those newborn babies, who depended on incubators, couldn't be moved. You can find several videos of that hospital's doctors pleading publicly with the IDF and international organizations to take care of the babies at the time they were forced to evacuate. You can even find the testimony of a doctor saying the IDF had assured him the babies would be taken care of. But when a journalist made his way back to the hospital a couple of weeks afterwards during the truce, he found the babies' bodies decomposing, still attached to their ventilators.  Even if one buys into the ""Hamas fighters in hospitals"" narrative, this cannot be a justification to let newborn babies die. The hospital was entirely emptied except for those babies, which everyone was made aware of (again, search for the statements by the doctors when they were forced to evacuate). What's the argument here: that because that hospital may at some point been harboring some Hamas fighters those babies were therefore somehow tainted and deserved to die? One can see how ridiculous an argument this is.  And also it's now crystal clear this whole ""Hamas hiding in hospitals"" narrative was just an excuse: the entire North of Gaza was evacuated, the whole place. So it's painfully obvious that hospitals were evacuated as part of this. Which makes the statement by the State Department's spokesperson even more contemptible: these babies didn't die because this particular hospital was a Hamas harbor but just because it happened to be located in North Gaza.",24485,"Dec 7, 2023 · 2:16 AM UTC"

We ask God Almighty for a speedy recovery for the wounded and sick, and we send a greeting of pride and pride to our patient people stationed firmly in the Gaza Strip, from north to south, and in its cities and camps steadfast in the face of... The Zionist war machine, in Jabalia, Al-Shati, Al-Nuseirat, Deir Al-Balah, Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, to which this wounded child (Leah Al-Houbi) was forcibly displaced from her home in Deir Al-Balah, and she was bombed by the Nazi occupation, and her words remain: (We must liberate our beloved Jerusalem and return to our homeland). -------------------  In the beginning, we reassure the masses of our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and all the free people in the world, that your victorious resistance is still leading and managing the chapters of the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood on the sixty-second day, with all strength, wisdom, and ability, in which it is writing a heroic epic, as it defends its people, its land, and its sanctity. The furthest of them is the blessed one, and it infiltrates the enemy's Nazi army, killing its soldiers and officers either dead or wounded, or permanently disabled, or completely or partially blinded, and destroying its military vehicles from a distance of zero, rendering them out of service or scattered in pieces, or charred by the cowardly, murderous soldiers in them. Of the mercenaries used by this Nazi enemy. While it was documented that “more than 410 Zionist military vehicles were completely or partially destroyed since the start of the ground aggression” on the Gaza Strip, and dozens of soldiers and officers of the occupation army and brigade commanders were killed, and according to the enemy’s confession, 90 soldiers and officers were killed, and certainly, the real number is many times that. The number of enemy wounded exceeds 2,000, hundreds of whom were seriously injured.  Our resistance fighters are still valiant in the field, and on all fronts. They are coming out from under the ground, above it, and from under the rubble. They are destroying its armored vehicles and tanks and killing its soldiers and officers. They are documenting this with audio and video.  These great sacrifices and daily field victories made by our resistors; At the forefront of them are the Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which is a prelude to the great victory, God Almighty willing, and our victorious resistance is ready to continue confronting and confronting the enemy with all strength and courage, regardless of the duration and extent of the aggression.

For #Gaza, where victims are far more numerous, photos and other humanising details of individual victims are much more scarce, due largely to the IDF raining bombs on and all around those who attempt to collect and disseminate this information.  We present here details of 17 Palestinian victims in Gaza (out of a reported 232) killed on the same day, Oct 7, for whom we found both names and a commemorative photograph online, usually from relatives and colleagues. These were not all gathered in one place, but remain scattered. Such records must be preserved before they are lost or removed from public view.  The Palestinian victims (of that day, and every subsequent day, in and outside of Gaza) deserve equal recognition and remembrance to all others killed by bombs and bullets.

455,@thehoffather,"BREAKING: @UW IS BEING ACCUSED OF DISCOURAGING ITS JEWISH STUDIES DEPARTMENT  ""FROM HOLDING PUBLIC EVENTS BASED ON THE NOTION THAT THIS WOULD PROVOKE CONFLICT ON CAMPUS""  Yet the school had no problem with Hamas rallies on campus including vigils for terrorists  See letter below:   Dear Director Hoffman, Dean Harris and President Cauce,  I am writing to ask you to condemn and disassociate our university from the ""week of learning and reflection"" on the Gaza War (see below) that would explicitly tie our faculties' scholarship to furthering a specific agenda of anti-Israel student activism.* Even a cursory glance at the titles of the presentations makes clear this is a political rally masquerading (poorly) as a pedagogical endeavour. If you subscribe to the premise that academic institutions are supposed to teach people how (not what) to think, then these events are antithetical to everything a university is meant to represent.  Before the attacks of October 7, I was proud to serve as the acting Associate Director of the Stroum Center for Jewish Studies after two years spent at UW as the Hazel D. Cole Postdoctoral Fellow. In the aftermath of 10/7, top UW administrators discouraged Jewish Studies from holding public events based on the notion that this would provoke conflict on campus. Stroum Center leadership refrained accordingly, acting in good faith as a partner to the administration. Even as academic programs whose members have no expertise on the region did (e.g., Ethnic Studies and the Counselling Office(!)) issued statements describing Israel and its supporters in the crassest terms, we said nothing. We instead turned to assist our students and provide them safe spaces. We did so because we believe that the role of the university is not indoctrination; it's education.  This situation is not sustainable. Swastikas have been scrawled on campus boards. Violent graffiti appears again and again in our public spaces.  I believe it is time for your administration to articulate a robust defense of dispassionate academic analysis and uphold the university as a place that accepts and fosters diverse perspectives. It is time to condemn on campus antisemitism and put together a task force to address it. If you can not do that, I and others will no longer be able to associate with this institution in good conscience.  Thank you for your time.  Best,  Brendan Goldman, PhD Interim Associate Director Stroum Center for Jewish Studies The University of Washington",873,"Dec 7, 2023 · 5:56 PM UTC"
