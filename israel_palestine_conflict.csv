I visited him in the Islamic University of Gaza, where he used English-language literature and poetry to teach his students the difference between Judaism and Zionism, equipping them with the mental tools to resist Zionist propaganda that seeks to conflate the two.  Refaat was a guiding light as a I documented life and death for my documentary, Killing Gaza. He helped me gain access to elders in his neighborhood who provided testimony of shocking Israeli war crimes.  In one of our last exchanges, I told him that, in my time in Gaza, I felt as though I were documenting the Warsaw Ghetto before its liquidation by Nazis. I promised him that his writings would be featured in a future Victims of Zionism museum. I didn't imagine that would be my last message to him.

The number of enemy wounded exceeds 2,000, hundreds of whom were seriously injured.  Our resistance fighters are still valiant in the field, and on all fronts. They are coming out from under the ground, above it, and from under the rubble. They are destroying its armored vehicles and tanks and killing its soldiers and officers. They are documenting this with audio and video.  These great sacrifices and daily field victories made by our resistors; At the forefront of them are the Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which is a prelude to the great victory, God Almighty willing, and our victorious resistance is ready to continue confronting and confronting the enemy with all strength and courage, regardless of the duration and extent of the aggression.

@MaryKostakidis,"Omer Bartov, professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, in the NYT: ‘What we had warned about — that it would be impossible to ignore the occupation and oppression of millions for 56 years, and the siege of Gaza for 16 years, without consequences — exploded in our faces on Oct. 7. Following Hamas’s massacre of innocent Jewish civilians, our same group issued a second petition denouncing the crimes committed by Hamas and calling upon the Israeli government to desist from perpetrating mass violence and killings upon innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza in response to the crisis. We wrote that the only way to put an end to these cycles of violence is to seek a political compromise with the Palestinians and end the occupation. It is time for leaders and senior scholars of institutions dedicated to researching and commemorating the Holocaust to publicly warn against the rage- and vengeance-filled rhetoric that dehumanizes the population of Gaza and calls for its extinction. It is time to speak out against the escalating violence on the West Bank, perpetrated by Israeli settlers and I.D.F. troops, which now appears to also be sliding toward ethnic cleansing under the cover of war in Gaza; several Palestinian villages have reportedly self-evacuated under threats from settlers. I urge such venerable institutions as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to step in now and stand at the forefront of those warning against war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and the crime of all crimes, genocide. If we truly believe that the Holocaust taught us a lesson about the need — or really, the duty — to preserve our own humanity and dignity by protecting those of others, this is the time to stand up and raise our voices, before Israel’s leadership plunges it and its neighbors into the abyss. There is still time to stop Israel from letting its actions become a genocide. We cannot wait a moment longer.’",303,"Dec 7, 2023 · 12:36 PM UTC"

This hysteric attempt to twist the meaning of Palestinian phraseology and conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism is absurd.

Intifada does not relate to genocide in any way, neither in meaning nor intent.   The Ivy League Jewish student is potentially one of the most protected and coddled demographics in the country.   To see them play the victim like this is not just disingenuous; it is incredibly narcissistic and intentionally deceptive.  We live in a dystopian reality, where real tragedies are overshadowed by a skewed narrative propagated by the privileged.  Consider how multiple Congressmen are affording a platform to students to articulate their concerns. These same congressmen that vote overwhelmingly to conflate antizionism with antisemitism and then provide billions of dollars of weapons for the continued murder of men, women, and children by the Zionist state.   And just about every media establishment in the country is covering this topic. The same media establishment that ignored the fact that 700 Palestinian civilians died in a single day!  But the Ivy school elite want to feign vulnerability ?   This is nothing more than a coordinated effort by Zionists in America to pressure university administrations into criminalizing the speech of their victims and political opponents. A tactic used throughout history by the oppressors on their victims.   They are no longer interested in debating whether the military occupation of Palestine is a brutal and illegal violation of human rights.   They no longer wish to discuss the racist apartheid system Israel has established in the West Bank.   They no longer wish to hear of the pogroms that displace Palestinians in the West Bank carried out by violent Israeli settlers; many of these settlers being American citizens!    They no longer wish to hear about the plight of the people of Gaza prior to October 7th.   They are tired of hearing about Palestinian human rights.  So they are exploiting this crisis to criminalize speech and censor it once and for all.   It's a shameful tactic and should be resisted by all those who profess to cherish free speech and human life.",2576,"Dec 7, 2023 · 4:55 PM UTC"

@RnaudBertrand,"What a disgusting answer to those 5 babies left to rot (literally) in Al-Nasr hospital, fact which he doesn't dispute but justifies by saying that ""Hamas should stop hiding its fighters in hospitals"". And he says this with a smirk on his face 🤢  In this particular case that hospital was forcibly evacuated by the IDF and those newborn babies, who depended on incubators, couldn't be moved. You can find several videos of that hospital's doctors pleading publicly with the IDF and international organizations to take care of the babies at the time they were forced to evacuate. You can even find the testimony of a doctor saying the IDF had assured him the babies would be taken care of. But when a journalist made his way back to the hospital a couple of weeks afterwards during the truce, he found the babies' bodies decomposing, still attached to their ventilators.  Even if one buys into the ""Hamas fighters in hospitals"" narrative, this cannot be a justification to let newborn babies die. The hospital was entirely emptied except for those babies, which everyone was made aware of (again, search for the statements by the doctors when they were forced to evacuate). What's the argument here: that because that hospital may at some point been harboring some Hamas fighters those babies were therefore somehow tainted and deserved to die? One can see how ridiculous an argument this is.  And also it's now crystal clear this whole ""Hamas hiding in hospitals"" narrative was just an excuse: the entire North of Gaza was evacuated, the whole place. So it's painfully obvious that hospitals were evacuated as part of this. Which makes the statement by the State Department's spokesperson even more contemptible: these babies didn't die because this particular hospital was a Hamas harbor but just because it happened to be located in North Gaza.",24485,"Dec 7, 2023 · 2:16 AM UTC"

We ask God Almighty for a speedy recovery for the wounded and sick, and we send a greeting of pride and pride to our patient people stationed firmly in the Gaza Strip, from north to south, and in its cities and camps steadfast in the face of... The Zionist war machine, in Jabalia, Al-Shati, Al-Nuseirat, Deir Al-Balah, Al-Maghazi, Al-Bureij, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, to which this wounded child (Leah Al-Houbi) was forcibly displaced from her home in Deir Al-Balah, and she was bombed by the Nazi occupation, and her words remain: (We must liberate our beloved Jerusalem and return to our homeland). -------------------  In the beginning, we reassure the masses of our Palestinian people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and all the free people in the world, that your victorious resistance is still leading and managing the chapters of the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood on the sixty-second day, with all strength, wisdom, and ability, in which it is writing a heroic epic, as it defends its people, its land, and its sanctity.

Of the mercenaries used by this Nazi enemy. While it was documented that “more than 410 Zionist military vehicles were completely or partially destroyed since the start of the ground aggression” on the Gaza Strip, and dozens of soldiers and officers of the occupation army and brigade commanders were killed, and according to the enemy’s confession, 90 soldiers and officers were killed, and certainly, the real number is many times that. The number of enemy wounded exceeds 2,000, hundreds of whom were seriously injured.  Our resistance fighters are still valiant in the field, and on all fronts. They are coming out from under the ground, above it, and from under the rubble. They are destroying its armored vehicles and tanks and killing its soldiers and officers. They are documenting this with audio and video.

For #Gaza, where victims are far more numerous, photos and other humanising details of individual victims are much more scarce, due largely to the IDF raining bombs on and all around those who attempt to collect and disseminate this information.  We present here details of 17 Palestinian victims in Gaza (out of a reported 232) killed on the same day, Oct 7, for whom we found both names and a commemorative photograph online, usually from relatives and colleagues. These were not all gathered in one place, but remain scattered. Such records must be preserved before they are lost or removed from public view.

What has Hamas done with the $billions in international aid that it has not built any protection for the people who live in Gaza?

@thehoffather,"BREAKING: @UW IS BEING ACCUSED OF DISCOURAGING ITS JEWISH STUDIES DEPARTMENT  ""FROM HOLDING PUBLIC EVENTS BASED ON THE NOTION THAT THIS WOULD PROVOKE CONFLICT ON CAMPUS""  Yet the school had no problem with Hamas rallies on campus including vigils for terrorists  See letter below:   Dear Director Hoffman, Dean Harris and President Cauce,  I am writing to ask you to condemn and disassociate our university from the ""week of learning and reflection"" on the Gaza War (see below) that would explicitly tie our faculties' scholarship to furthering a specific agenda of anti-Israel student activism.* Even a cursory glance at the titles of the presentations makes clear this is a political rally masquerading (poorly) as a pedagogical endeavour. If you subscribe to the premise that academic institutions are supposed to teach people how (not what) to think, then these events are antithetical to everything a university is meant to represent.  Before the attacks of October 7, I was proud to serve as the acting Associate Director of the Stroum Center for Jewish Studies after two years spent at UW as the Hazel D. Cole Postdoctoral Fellow. In the aftermath of 10/7, top UW administrators discouraged Jewish Studies from holding public events based on the notion that this would provoke conflict on campus. Stroum Center leadership refrained accordingly, acting in good faith as a partner to the administration. Even as academic programs whose members have no expertise on the region did (e.g., Ethnic Studies and the Counselling Office(!)) issued statements describing Israel and its supporters in the crassest terms, we said nothing. We instead turned to assist our students and provide them safe spaces. We did so because we believe that the role of the university is not indoctrination; it's education.  This situation is not sustainable. Swastikas have been scrawled on campus boards. Violent graffiti appears again and again in our public spaces.  I believe it is time for your administration to articulate a robust defense of dispassionate academic analysis and uphold the university as a place that accepts and fosters diverse perspectives. It is time to condemn on campus antisemitism and put together a task force to address it. If you can not do that, I and others will no longer be able to associate with this institution in good conscience.  Thank you for your time.

A second reason they can't be fighters is that Palestinian freedom fighters DO NOT mass surrender, as they believe in, and strongly prefer martyrdom.  3. IF they were fighters, pictures would be presented of their weapons - none have been shown.  4. What is being sold as a 'military victory' is in fact a WAR CRIME - and worries are rising that these civilian men will be summarily executed.  5. Zionists all over social media are cheering over this new Israeli fabrication - and that is exactly the purpose of this lie. The Israeli army wants to show the Israeli public a victory, so it makes one up. It is clearly working, as cognitive dissonance has had Israelis believing in almost every lie, while the rest of the world has been ridiculing them.  6. These pictures will do nothing to give hope to the Israeli public of retrieving the hostages - as these civilians themselves may he tortured, but actually have no knowledge of anything, including the whereabouts of the hostages.  7.

@DrShadeeElmasry,"Everyone has to make judgement calls. Some imams have made decisions that now disallow them form saying a single critical word about Israel's actions, the IDF, Zionism, or Rabbinical rulings that encourage killing kids (Kahane, Mizrahi, Reuven, et al).  (I am referring to all those who are *not* living under dictators that would imprison or kill them for speaking; their silence is permitted in Sharia and they are free of blame.)  Without doubt, the silence of those living in free countries, is blameworthy in the Sharia.   Imams are meant to clarify what is bad, not just what is good. And this includes the evil in the world, not just errors in theology.  We should all take an example from this, and they too should think about the arrangements they've made that disallow them to speak about such a clear cut matter.  While we can judge this inaction as very blameworthy, I do not want to pass a judgement as to *why* they are silent. I will not assume the worst. Perhaps it is merely a poor judgement call (which we can all fall into). Perhaps it is something completely different that we don't know.   In sum, it's sad to see and it's wrong, and it should be spoken about, but I won't assume the worst about them, especially those with decades of serving the deen.",88,"Dec 8, 2023 · 2:17 AM UTC"

Zionism is not a religion, but a political ideology. The religion of the Jews is Judaism, not Zionism. Therefore, being against Zionism cannot be considered an enemy of the Jews.  The US government, under the influence of Israel and Zionist lobbies, made a historical mistake and declared that all Jews are enemies of Judaism.

This is what was used in cooking to fry things EVERYWHERE before the seed oil industry paid off heart doctors to recommend ‘low cholesterol diets’ and fearmongered people away from healthy animal saturated fats.   Potatoes 🥔 have vitamin c, potassium  and vitamin b6 and are a clean carbohydrate source.   beef 🐄 tallow provides: vitamin A, D and E as well as powerful fatty acids for energy.   If you fry things with beef tallow, they are healthy. Seed oils (consisting of processed polyunsaturated fatty acids) are highly damaging to the body and are what makes fast food unhealthy.   If it was good quality ingredients, I’d eat McDonalds - IF they used beef tallow to fry their fries.   RECIPE: heat up beef tallow so that the potato cubes will be nearly submerged, once warm, put in potatoes.   Add a bit of rosemary.   Fry until golden brown, moving and stirring the potatoes frequently.   Use a spoon to slightly break up the potatoes once they get softer for added crisp.

@Al_HindMuslims,"Palestine and the Information War  “If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” ― Malcolm X  Over two thousand years ago, the Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu recognized that wars are fought not only on the battlefield. “To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the height of (military) skill”, he said. “To subdue the enemy without fighting, that is the height of (military) skill”.  To achieve this, Sun Tzu further said, ‘A leader who wants to go to battle must first unite his people behind him. The people must be convinced he has their interests at heart, and that these interests are fair, righteous and just. If at the same time the enemy can be divided and demotivated, the battle is likely to be won well before a sword is drawn or a shot is fired.”  In the modern world, countries follow Sun Tzu’s sage advice by engaging in information warfare. Information warfare is a narrative or a storyline that gives meaning to a series of events and occurrences. As such, a narrative guides people to a specific understanding, and thereby to specific opinions and feelings regarding what is happening around them.  A famous example of narrative warfare is America’s effort to win “hearts and minds” as part of its war in Iraq.[1] In order to unite Western audiences behind America’s plan to invade and occupy Iraq, the American military hired a private company, the Rendon Group, to change the image of Saddam Hussein from “evil but weak dictator” to “powerful evil dictator with weapons of mass destruction intent on causing war globally”.[2] And in order to discourage the people of Iraq from fighting in support of Saddam Hussein’s regime, America dropped more than 25 million leaflets in Iraq which encouraged Iraqi civilians and soldiers to not only see Saddam Hussein as the evil dictator he was, but also America as a benevolent liberator.[3] Thereafter, when the American military in Iraq began to be confronted by a popular resistance movement because it failed to act as a benevolent liberator, America launched a propaganda campaign to make the people believe the popular resistance was in reality a branch of Al Qaeda, led by a Jordanian with the name Musab Al Zarqawi. This was done firstly to hide the fact there was a popular resistance in Iraq, and secondly to get Western and Iraqi audiences to support America’s military actions against this popular resistance.[4]",1,"Dec 8, 2023 · 2:08 AM UTC"
