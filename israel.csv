Here is a list of observations that I hope you take to heart:  1. These are not fighters: several of them have been recognized BY NAME as civilians on social media.  2. A second reason they can't be fighters is that Palestinian freedom fighters DO NOT mass surrender, as they believe in, and strongly prefer martyrdom.  3. IF they were fighters, pictures would be presented of their weapons - none have been shown.  4. What is being sold as a 'military victory' is in fact a WAR CRIME - and worries are rising that these civilian men will be summarily executed.  5. Zionists all over social media are cheering over this new Israeli fabrication - and that is exactly the purpose of this lie. The Israeli army wants to show the Israeli public a victory, so it makes one up. It is clearly working, as cognitive dissonance has had Israelis believing in almost every lie, while the rest of the world has been ridiculing them.  6. These pictures will do nothing to give hope to the Israeli public of retrieving the hostages - as these civilians themselves may he tortured, but actually have no knowledge of anything, including the whereabouts of the hostages.  7. It remains to be seen how Western media will respond to these publications, but for the Israeli propaganda purposes outside of 'Israel', these pictures practically serve no goal.",12466,"Dec 7, 2023 · 3:18 PM UTC"

It’s the countries surrounding it that don’t like it and want to wipe it out.   So don’t come at us with “genocide”   Using those buzz words have been a projection of the Arab world’s crimes against the Jewish people to wipe their slate clean of being guilty of those atrocities.

Some imams have made decisions that now disallow them form saying a single critical word about Israel's actions, the IDF, Zionism, or Rabbinical rulings that encourage killing kids (Kahane, Mizrahi, Reuven, et al).  (I am referring to all those who are *not* living under dictators that would imprison or kill them for speaking; their silence is permitted in Sharia and they are free of blame.)  Without doubt, the silence of those living in free countries, is blameworthy in the Sharia.   Imams are meant to clarify what is bad, not just what is good. And this includes the evil in the world, not just errors in theology.  We should all take an example from this, and they too should think about the arrangements they've made that disallow them to speak about such a clear cut matter.  While we can judge this inaction as very blameworthy, I do not want to pass a judgement as to *why* they are silent. I will not assume the worst. Perhaps it is merely a poor judgement call (which we can all fall into). Perhaps it is something completely different that we don't know.

377,@SolBrah,"FRIED POTATOES ARE A HEALTH FOOD  The KEY is in what fat you fry them in.   I made these crispy fried potatoes using grassfed and finished BEEF tallow. Recipe below.   This is what was used in cooking to fry things EVERYWHERE before the seed oil industry paid off heart doctors to recommend ‘low cholesterol diets’ and fearmongered people away from healthy animal saturated fats.   Potatoes 🥔 have vitamin c, potassium  and vitamin b6 and are a clean carbohydrate source.   beef 🐄 tallow provides: vitamin A, D and E as well as powerful fatty acids for energy.   If you fry things with beef tallow, they are healthy. Seed oils (consisting of processed polyunsaturated fatty acids) are highly damaging to the body and are what makes fast food unhealthy.   If it was good quality ingredients, I’d eat McDonalds - IF they used beef tallow to fry their fries.   RECIPE: heat up beef tallow so that the potato cubes will be nearly submerged, once warm, put in potatoes.   Add a bit of rosemary.   Fry until golden brown, moving and stirring the potatoes frequently.   Use a spoon to slightly break up the potatoes once they get softer for added crisp.   Add sea salt throughout and more to taste once cooked. I like to serve with butter.   Try these Fries.",515,"Dec 8, 2023 · 12:06 AM UTC"

462,@zoo_bear,"Refaat Alareer was killed by @Israel today.   In his recent interview in October,  ""There is no way out of Gaza. What should we do... drown? Commit mass suicide? Is this what Israel wants? And we're not going to do that.. I am an academic, Probably the toughest thing I have at home is an Expo Marker. But if the Israelis invade us, If they barge at us, open door to door to massacre us, I am going to use that Marker, Throw it at the Israeli soldiers, even if that is the last thing that I will be able to do. And this is the feeling of everybody in Palestine. We are helpless and we have nothing to lose""",1433,"Dec 7, 2023 · 9:06 PM UTC"
